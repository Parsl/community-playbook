# üè¶ Funding and Support
Parsl work today is supported by a combination of sources, including an NSF SI2 award in its final year, in-house funding at U Chicago and U Illinois, external funding from projects and collaborations that depend on Parsl and have budgeted to partially support it, volunteer (in-kind) effort from groups that develop tools that use Parsl or add to Parsl‚Äôs capabilities as well as students who come across Parsl and find it useful, research projects that extend Parsl in various ways, and companies that use Parsl in their services.

With grants from NSF and CZI, Parsl is entering its next phase toward sustainability. These awards provide funding to build on existing capabilities, define and implement an open governance structure, improve systems and architecture, enhance the open source process, support a dedicated community manager to prioritize engagement and outreach efforts, increase training and support opportunities, and allow the project to continue to grow and innovate.
