# ðŸŽ¥ Recorded Talks
Giving a talk at our open community calls is a great way for community members to share progress and updates on their Parsl-related projects/work. In doing so, users can work through challenges together, answer questions, and raise awareness of their work. <br><br>**Check out recorded talks from past open community calls here â¬‡**
