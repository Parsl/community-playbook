# Community Blog Overview

Our [blog](https://parsl-project.org/blog.html) is a space to share ideas, research, and opportunities and raise awareness of the exciting things happening around our community. It‚Äôs a place for collaboration and storytelling where you can share your knowledge, insights, and experiences using Parsl.

Members can contribute different types of content on a range of topics, including:
- Project breakthroughs and results
- Troubleshooting issues, findings, and solutions
- Developments and features
- Important updates surrounding community activities and more

We understand that writing a blog post can take time. To make things easier, we are sharing some general guidelines, an overview of the editorial process, and templates to support members with developing and creating blog posts.

## üìè Content Guidelines
- We are looking for content that showcases your work that uses Parsl and stories about your overall experiences, challenges, takeaways, solutions, and best practices and tips.
- English writing and grammar are required. If English is a secondary language, don‚Äôt worry! Please try your best to express your ideas, and your fellow Community members will appreciate your insights.
- This space is sharing knowledge and experience, not advertising products and services.
- Be mindful of accuracy and ensure you have permission to share specific information and aspects of your work, as our blog is public.
- Keep it relevant and use section headers to make content more accessible to read.
- Use visual content (images, graphics, and videos) to provide context and examples.
- Include the appropriate acknowledgments and citations as needed
- We encourage you to share visual assets (graphics, images, and videos) that can accompany your written content

## üìñ Editorial Review Process
The coordination team will review submitted content for accuracy, misspellings, and grammatical errors. We will share any revision suggestions with you for approval before publishing them on our site.
